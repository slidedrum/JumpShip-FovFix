<h1>Obsolete</h1>

The game now has an official FOV slider. This is no longer needed, Yay!  Might update this to allow for changing FOV in other scenarios.  But not really needed I feel.

Old description:

This will allow you to change the FOV in jumpship straight from the options menu.  Slightly less jank than it was, still jank.  Will break some viewmodels.  Todo:  remove as much as possible from the update method, instead use harmony hooks.
